## The Problem

If your agents call paid APIs directly, you don't have:
- **Cost control** – No budget limits, no spending caps
- **Retry limits** – Failed calls can loop indefinitely
- **Failure ownership** – No clear accountability when things go wrong

Your AI agent needs to generate an image. It calls DALL-E. The call fails. It retries. Fails again. Retries 10 more times.

**You just burned $5 on nothing.**

---

## The Solution

VAP is an **Execution Control Layer** that sits between AI agents and paid external APIs.

It enforces:
- **Pre-commit pricing** – Know exact cost before execution
- **Hard budget guarantees** – Reserve → Burn → Refund model
- **Deterministic retry behavior** – No runaway costs
- **Explicit execution ownership** – Every task has an owner

---

## How It Works

```
Agent: "Generate an image of a sunset"
    ↓
VAP: "That will cost $0.18. Reserving..."
VAP: "Reserved. Executing..."
VAP: "Success. Burning $0.18. Here's your image."
```

If it fails:

```
Agent: "Generate an image of a sunset"
    ↓
VAP: "That will cost $0.18. Reserving..."
VAP: "Reserved. Executing..."
VAP: "Failed. Refunding $0.18. Error: Provider timeout"
```

**Your agent never sees the complexity. It just gets deterministic results.**

## Pricing

| Type | Preset | Price |
|------|--------|-------|
| Image | `image.basic` | **$0.18** |
| Video | `video.basic` | **$1.96** |
| Music | `music.basic` | **$0.68** |
| Campaign | `streaming_campaign` | **$5.90** |
| Full Production | `full_production` | **$7.90** |

No surprises. No variable pricing. No "it depends."

## SDK Usage

### Installation

```bash
pip install vape-client
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from vape_client import VAPClient

client = VAPClient(api_key="your_api_key")

# Cost is pre-committed: $0.18
result = client.generate_image(
    prompt="A serene mountain landscape at sunset"
)

print(f"Image URL: {result.url}")
print(f"Cost: ${result.cost}")
```

### Async Usage

```python
import asyncio
from vape_client import AsyncVAPClient

async def main():
    client = AsyncVAPClient(api_key="your_api_key")

    # Budget enforced, retries limited
    result = await client.generate_image(
        prompt="A futuristic cityscape"
    )
    print(f"Image URL: {result.url}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/v3/generate` | POST | Create media execution task |
| `/v3/tasks/{id}` | GET | Retrieve task status |
| `/v3/tasks/{id}/result` | GET | Retrieve task result |
| `/v3/balance` | GET | Check account balance |

## The Three Guarantees

### 1. Pre-Commit Pricing
Every task has a known cost before execution. No surprises.

### 2. Budget Enforcement
Set a max budget. VAP enforces it. Hit the limit? Task rejected. Balance protected.

### 3. Failure Ownership
Every task has an explicit owner. Every failure has an address. No more "the agent did something and I don't know what."
